# Color Memory
A game to memorize and repeat the color sequence for Arduino platform.

## How To Play
1. Push the `START` button to start a game.
2. Watch the lights flashing and try to memorize the sequence.
3. Try to repeat the sequence pushing corresponding buttons.
4. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the green light flases.  Push the `START` button again to procede to the next round.
5. The objective of each level is to reproduce the sequence correctly certain times in a row. If you reach the level objective, you get a level-up, making the game harder.
6. If you enter an incorrect sequence, the red light flashes, the round is restarted, and you lose one life.
7. When the number of lives drops down to zero, the game is reset to its starting point.
